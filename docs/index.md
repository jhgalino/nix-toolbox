# Fedora Toolbox üå∂Ô∏è with Nix and Home Manager

This project builds on top of Fedora Toolbx container image and adds Nix package manager and optionally Home Manager for the following benefits:

* Dead simple to access 100k+ packages in the Nix package manager from Fedora Silverblue variants and Fedora Image Mode systems
* Make it easy to re-create development environments using Nix without too much work
* Use Home Manager to manage configuration of Fedora packages,
* Bring Fedora and Nix ecosystems closer together
