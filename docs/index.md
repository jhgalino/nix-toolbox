# Nix Toolbox - Fedora Toolbox üå∂Ô∏è with Nix and Home Manager

This project builds on top of [Fedora Toolbox](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/) container image and adds Nix package manager and optionally Home Manager for the following benefits:

* The easiest way to get [Nix](https://nixos.org/learn/) and [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/) working on [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org) and [Fedora Atomic Desktops](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/)
* Simple access to 100k+ packages in the [Nix Packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages) collection
* Support for [Nix-based development environment](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/development/intro) used by various open-source projects
* Use Home Manager to manage your home environment as code, and partially also system environment
* Works well with [Toolbx](https://containertoolbx.org) or [Distrobox](https://distrobox.it)
